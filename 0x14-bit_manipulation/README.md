## Project Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing bit manipulation techniques and bitwise operators in the C programming language. The primary objective of this project is to explore the world of bits, practice problem-solving, and learn to work with low-level operations.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Look for the right source of information without too much help.
- Manipulate bits and use bitwise operators effectively.
- Write clean and well-documented C code.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options.
- All code files should follow the Betty style.
- No global variables are allowed.
- Use of only specific C standard library functions.
- Use of the _putchar function.
- Include a header file named main.h with proper include guards.
